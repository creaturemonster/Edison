<p>With his move from Menlo Park, New Jersey, to New York City at the end of March 1881, Edison shifted his focus from research and development to the commercialization of his electric lighting system. This volume chronicles Edison’s central role in the enormous effort required to manufacture, market, and install electric lighting systems in the United States and abroad. Standard studies of this period emphasize the inauguration of the commercial electric utility industry at the Pearl Street central station, but Edison and his associates audaciously operated on a global scale, not just focusing on the major cities of North America and Europe, but reaching simultaneously from Appleton, Wisconsin, to Australia, through the Indian subcontinent and East Asia, to Central and South America.</p>
<p>Edison initially devoted his energies to the four manufacturing  plants that produced electrical equipment, lamps, and underground conductors. He controlled two of these concerns, the Edison Lamp Company and the Edison Machine Works, and had large stakes in the other two, the Electric Tube Company and Bergmann & Company. Employing more than a thousand workers, these shops operated as partnerships with close associates from his Menlo Park laboratory, who also managed the day to day operations. The manufacturing shops were independent of the Edison Electric Light Company and their expanding operations put heavy demands on Edison’s personal ﬁnances.</p>

<p>Producing durable, standardized incandescent lamps in large quantities and at low cost presented Edison with his greatest manufacturing challenge. It was for this reason that he had established the lamp factory in Menlo Park in the second half of 1880 as part of the research and development effort. The experience of those who had learned the art of making lamps in the laboratory was vital to the early manufacturing effort, as was the work of the laboratory’s machine shop, which provided instruments, other equipment, and repairs for the factory. Although Edison spent little time at the lamp factory, he received frequent reports from superintendent Francis Upton regarding the extensive experiments on lamp design and manufacture, which served as the basis for Edison’s numerous patents on these subjects. When he discovered a no table decline in lamp durability in the fall of 1881, he virtually lived at the lamp factory for ten days until he had improved the manufacturing process so that the vacuum and the lamps would last longer than ever. At this time the lamp factory’s output was intended for isolated lighting plants. This was also true of the other factories except for the Tube Works, which manufactured the underground conductors that were laid starting in September for the Pearl Street central station dis- trict in lower Manhattan.</p>

<p>Although Edison believed that the future of electric lighting lay in central station service, he did not expect the Pearl Street station to be ready for almost a year and acknowledged the short-term importance of lighting individual buildings to promote his incandescent system. Isolated lighting also provided a market for the large manufacturing capabilities he would need to construct central stations. He and the chief engineer of the Edison Electric Light Company, Charles Clarke, therefore developed a series of standardized dynamos to ad- vance this business, which expanded rapidly. Isolated incandescent lighting plants soon began to provide light in textile mills, where open-ﬂame lighting was dangerous, and to replace gas and kerosene lights in a wide range of industrial and commercial establishments. Although unwilling to participate in the manufacturing operations, the Edison Electric Light Company did develop and run the isolated business. </p>

<p>As at the lamp factory, Edison’s other manufacturing enter- prises were the site of most of the ongoing experimental work necessary to improve the commercial incandescent lighting system. Because these efforts were dispersed in the shops, many of the experimental records have not survived. Often the only records that remain are Edison’s memoranda and drafts for the nearly 200 patent applications he ﬁled during this period. The improvements embodied in these patents not only led to improved devices and processes, but the patents themselves were intended to block potential rivals.</p>
 
<p>The relatively small number of technical records from this period is also a product of Edison’s increasing involvement in business operations. Because of this and the fact that some correspondence was carried on in Edison’s name by Samuel Insull, who served not only as his secretary but also his busi- ness manager, it is more difﬁcult than ever in this period to gain a clear view of Edison himself.</p>

<p>As work proceeded on the Pearl Street station and the isolated business continued to grow in the United States, promotional efforts in Paris and London prepared the way for expansion into Europe. Edison entrusted Charles Batchelor with the responsibility for his exhibit at the International Electrical Exposition, which opened in Paris at the end of August 1881. This exhibit generated widespread favorable publicity as the European scientiﬁc and technical community witnessed for the ﬁrst time the ambitious scope of the Edison system. Edi- son soon sent Edward Johnson to London to promote his system there and received accolades for his exhibit at the Crystal Palace Electrical Exhibition the following winter.</p>

<p>Negotiations begun in the last months of 1881 soon resulted in the formation of companies in Britain and France to exploit Edison’s electric light system. In London, Johnson worked to organize the Edison Electric Light Company Ltd., but his primary mission was to set up a demonstration central station to convince prospective British investors and consumers of the reliability and economy of the Edison system. He and Egisto Fabbri, a partner in Drexel, Morgan & Company (which con- trolled Edison’s British patents), selected a site on London’s famous Holborn Viaduct, where the station opened in April 1882. Edison also urged George Gouraud, his longtime busi- ness representative there, to market isolated lighting plants in British colonies and other countries outside Europe and Britain. This led to the formation of Edison’s Indian & Colo- nial Electric Light Company.</p>

<p>In France, Joshua Bailey, previously involved in negotiating the combined telephone company that included Edison’s pat- ents, took the lead in forming manufacturing and operating companies for the commercial development of Edison’s elec- tric light system in Europe: the Société Industrielle et Commerciale Edison to manufacture lamps and other components of the Edison system, the Compagnie Continentale to organ- ize and license electric light companies throughout continen- tal Europe, and the Société Électrique to build central stations in France. Charles Batchelor acted as Edison’s representative in these companies and also had charge of the lamp factory and machine shop at Ivry-sur-Seine just outside the Paris city walls. Elsewhere in Europe, Bailey and Theodore Puskas ne- gotiated for isolated plants and utility companies in smaller cities not covered by the Compagnie Continentale, including Strasbourg and Milan. In order to coordinate the exploitation of his patents in various European countries, Edison organized a patent holding company, the Edison Electric Light Company of Europe. Egisto Fabbri was among the investors in this company, purchasing a large block of shares on behalf of Drexel, Morgan. Fabbri was actively involved in the nego- tiations in Paris and London, and also organized companies in South America and Mexico. Edison’s foreign operations involved an expanding network of ﬁnanciers and banks in Europe, often facilitated through the agency of Fabbri and Drexel, Morgan. </p>

<p>During negotiations for the formation of the British and European companies, both Johnson and Batchelor expressed concern over the state of Edison’s foreign patents. Edison agreed to a systematic review by outside legal experts of his British lighting patents, which led to his submitting ﬁve spec- iﬁcations for disclaimer in order to protect his carbon-ﬁlament lamp. He also hired patent attorney Richard Dyer to take charge of all his patent affairs. Dyer worked closely with Edison to draft his U. S. and foreign speciﬁcations. He sent foreign speciﬁcations to agents abroad, who were familiar with local patent laws, for revision and ﬁling.</p>

<p>The stress of overseeing four major factories, solving a myriad of major and minor technical problems, supervising the in- stallation of the Pearl Street station and miles of underground conductors, and negotiating the organization of companies to operate throughout the world wore out Edison. After vaca- tioning with his family in Florida during winter 1882, he fell ill and remained in bed most of the second half of April. During this time he delegated his business affairs to Samuel Insull, who had the task of integrating the production of the shops with the demand for their goods throughout the United States and abroad.
The rapid growth of the lighting business led Edison to expand his production facilities. The lamp factory moved from Menlo Park to Harrison, New Jersey (across the river from Newark), in spring 1882 and began to employ female workers to reduce the costs of its large labor force. During that summer Edison expanded the Machine Works and soon had about 800 men employed in the production of dynamos. In September he formalized his partnership in Bergmann & Company, which soon moved into a large six-story shop, with Edison tak- ing the top ﬂoor for his laboratory.</p>

<p>After spending most of the summer of 1882 at Menlo Park, Edison moved back to New York in order to be close to the nearly completed Pearl Street station. Edison and Clarke had designed steam dynamos for central stations; in July, six of these massive machines were installed and tested and the un- derground network was completed. Over the next month the system was tested discreetly and found to work. Then on 4 September, after giving the station a ﬁnal inspection, Edison went to the ofﬁce of J. P. Morgan to inaugurate it and the commercial electric utility industry. It was almost four years to the day since he had begun intensive research into electric lighting.</p>

<p>The Pearl Street station seems more signiﬁcant in retro- spect than it appeared at the time. Although central stations were Edison’s vision and the future of electric light and power, the large number of isolated plants that preceded Pearl Street meant that commercial electric lighting had already lost its novelty. Nonetheless, there was a demand for lighting in smaller towns and cities for which the expensive underground system in New York was infeasible. This led Edison to develop what he termed the Village Plant System, which used over- head conductors. The ﬁrst Village System station began operating in Roselle, New Jersey, in January 1883. By March, Edison had decided to set up a separate company to promote and install small central stations throughout the United States.</p>
