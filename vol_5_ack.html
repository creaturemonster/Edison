<p>The progress of the Thomas A. Edison Papers depends on the support of many individuals and organizations, including the Sponsors, other ﬁnancial contributors, academic scholars, Edison specialists, librarians, archivists, curators, and students. Representatives of the four Sponsors have assisted with this volume and the editors thank them for their continuing concern and attention. The strong support of public and pri- vate foundations and of their program ofﬁcers has sustained the project and helped it remain editorially productive.</p>

<p>Preparation of this volume was made possible in part by grants from the Division of Research Programs (Collaborative Research) of the National Endowment for the Humanities, an independent federal agency; the National Historical Publica- tions and Records Commission; the New Jersey Historical Commission; the Charles Edison Fund; the National Trust for the Humanities; as well as through the support of Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, and the National Park Service (Edison National Historic Site). The editors appreciate the interest and support of the many program ofﬁcers and trustees, especially Elizabeth Arndt, Michael Hall, Timothy Connolly, Howard Green, Mary Murrin, John P. Keegan, Ann Orr, and Thomas L. Morrissey. Any opinions, ﬁndings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in this publication are solely those of the editors and do not necessarily reﬂect the views of any of the above federal foundations or agencies, the United States Government, or any other ﬁnancial contributor. The Edison Papers project is indebted to the National Park Service for its multifaceted support. The editors express particular thanks to Marie Rust, John Maounis, and Nancy Wa- ters of the Northeast Region and Maryanne Gerbauckas, Terri Jung, Roger Durham, Leonard DeGraaf, Douglas Tarr, Edward Wirth, Karen Sloat-Olsen, and Linda Deveau of the
Edison National Historic Site in West Orange, New Jersey.</p>

<p>Many associates at Rutgers University have contributed signiﬁcantly to the Edison Papers. The editors are grateful to Holly M. Smith, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, and her predecessor Richard F. Foley, along with their dedi- cated staff, especially Barry V. Qualls, Dean for Humanities, and Robert Wilson, Executive Vice Dean. We would especially like to thank Judith Brooke, Associate Director of Development for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. The editors value the support of colleagues and staff in the History Department, especially Ann Gordon, Deborah White, Philip J. Pauly, Su- san Schrepfer, Michael Adas, James W. Reed, John Gillis, Ziva Galili, Rudy Bell, and John Chambers; Michael Geselowitz and his staff at the IEEE History Center; as well as members of the Rutgers University Libraries, notably Marianne Gaunt, Ruth Simmons, Ron Becker, Thomas Frusciano, and Grace Agnew. The support of the Rutgers University administration has encouraged the editors and facilitated their work. The staff of the project thank Joseph J. Seneca, David A. Rumbo, Ronald Thompson, Karen James, Jacquelyn Halvsa, Robert Thieme, Joseph M. Harrigan, Constance J. Bornheimer, Judith A. Garelick, Irma Lucy Cardinale, and Sameerah Diaab Allen. Roy Marantz and David Cruz of Rutgers Computing Services and John Amodeo, Thomas Vosseler and the staff of the Fac- ulty of Arts and Sciences Computer & Network Operations Group have offered their invaluable computer expertise.</p>

<p>Many scholars have shared their insights and assisted the editors in a variety of ways. For this volume, notable help came from Bernard W. Carlson, Bernard S. Finn, Robert Friedel, Leonard F. Guttridge, Charles Hummel, Peter L. Jakab, Sean F. Johnston, Ronald Kline, René Rondeau, and Marc Rothenberg. Institutions and their staff have provided documents, photographs, photocopies, and research assistance. The staff of the Henry Ford Museum & Greenﬁeld Village—especially William S. Pretzer, Marc Greuther, Charles Hanson, Judy Endelman, Linda Skolarus, and Jeanine Head—have supplied many invaluable services. The editors appreciate the profes- sional courtesies of John Fleckner and Robert Harding at the National Museum of  American History’s Archives Center; John Liffen, Robert Bud, and Emily Lewis of the Science Mu- seum in London; Tim Procter and Lenore Symons of the Institute of Electrical Engineers in London, Sheldon Hoch- heiser, AT&T Corporate Historian; Mary Bowling at New York Public Library; Florence Bartechevski of the Baker Li- brary at Harvard University; the staff at the Historical Society of Pennsylvania; and Irene Kovacs at the Foundation of the Postal and Telecommunication Museum in Budapest. The City of Ft. Myers, Florida, and the trustees and staff of its Edison-Ford Winter Homes—notably Michele Wehrwein Al- bion, Judy Suprise, Jim Newton, and Les Marietta—have as- sisted the Edison Papers. Outside computer advice has come from Michael Sperberg-McQueen and the members of the Model Editions Partnership. </p>
