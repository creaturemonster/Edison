<p>The Thomas A. Edison Papers project continues to benefit from substantial assistance from many quarters, including the Sponsors, other financial contributors, scholars, archivists, curators, collectors, and students. All of the representatives from the four sponsoring institutions have given generously of their time and energies, but the project is especially indebted to the late Edward ]. Bloustein (to whom this volume is dedi­ cated), T. Alexander Pond, Fahy Whitaker, Bernard Bush, Howard Green, and Bernard Finn for their sustained per­ sonal interest and institutional support. Likewise, the mem­ bers of the Corporate Associates and the Editorial Advisory Board have responded to particular needs of the project. Es­ pecially notable for their contributions are William C. Hittin­ ger and Nathan Reingold. At the  Rutgers University Foun­ dation, Bruce Newman and Dick Lloyd have made the project a  priority.</p>
<p>Public and private foundation grants continue to play a vital role.The preparation of this volume was made possible in part by grants from the Division of Research Programs (Editions­ Texts) of the National Endowment for the Humanities, an in­ dependent federal agency, by grants from the Program in His­ tory and Philosophy of Science and the Engineering Division of the National Science Foundation (DIR-8521524), and with the assistance of the National Park Service, Edison National Historic Site. Katherine Fuller and Douglas M. Arnold of the National Endowment for the Humanities and Ronald Over­ mann and Nam Suh of the National Science Foundation have provided valuable counsel. Grants from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and the Charles Edison Fund also have contrib­ uted significantly to this volume. Albert Rees, Stewart F. Campbell, Paul Christiansen, John Venable, David Shantz,
John P. Keegan, Robert W Parsons, Jr., Scott McVay, and Thomas L. Morrissey have offered key counsel. Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this publication are solely those of the editors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the  United States Government, or any other financial  contributor.</p>
<p>The editors are grateful to many scholars for their publi­ cations, professional presentations, teaching, and private discussions. For this volume the editors are especially indebted to Brian Bowers, James Brittain, John Bryant, Aaron Ihde, and Frank W. Dittman.</p>
<p>The project is indebted to many institutions and their staffs for providing documents, photographs, photocopies, and re­ search assistance. Staff members of the Henry Ford Museum and the Greenfield Village have extended themselves, especially William S. Pretzer, John Bowditch, Tim Binkley, and Rudy Ruzicska. Similar help came from Joyce Bedi of the History Center of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and from Jeff Sturchio of the Corporate Research Archives at AT&T. The editors also received assistance from Florence Bartechevski of the Baker Library at Harvard University, Ir­ ene Coffee of the Franklin Institute, Mrs. C. I. Constantin­ ides of the Post Office Archives in London, Jane Hardy of the Stevens Institute, Margaret Jasko of Western Union Tele­ graph Company, Janice Pickering of the U.S. Patent Office, Lenore Symons of the Institute of Electrical Engineers in London, and Steven Wheeler of the New York Stock Ex­ change Archives. The project is indebted to several persons in the Federal Archives and Record Services: John Butler, Marjorie Ciarlante, and Sue McDonough in Washington, D.C.; and Joel Buchwald  and Donna Cabarle in Bayonne,N.J. Others who have provided resources or special assistance include Charles Hummel, Theodore Edison, and John Edison Sloane.</p>
<p>Many people associated with the National Park Service have contributed significantly to this project. Worthy of special mention are Herbert S. Cables, Jr., Gerald R. Patten, John Maounis, and Edward Dallop of the Boston Regional Office and Fahy Whitaker, Nancy Waters, Mary Bowling, George Tselos, and Edward Pershey of the Edison National Historic Site.</p>
<p>The project benefits from many friends within Rutgers University who have given assistane. The editors are appre­ ciative of the efforts of colleagues in the History Department, especially James W. Reed, Susan R. Schrepfer, Philip ). Pauly, Gerald Grob, Michael Adas, Richard L. McCormick, Rudy Bell, and John Gillis. All of the staff of the Rutgers University Libraries have given fine service, but noteworthy is the help given by Ruth Simmons, Ronald L. Becker, and Clark L. Beck, Jr. Administrative people who are special contributors to this project include Paul L. Leath, Peter D. Klein, Robert
F. Pack, John Salapatas, David A. Cayer, Andrew B. Rudczynski, C. Fred Main, Francis A. Baran, David A. Rumbo, Bar­ bara A. Reis, Albert Hanna, Donna Estler, Muriel Wilson, Cynthia Jucks, and Joseph Harrigan.</p>

<p>The Johns Hopkins University Press, under the direction of Jack Goellner, has heroically undertaken the unusually complex job of publishing the Edison Papers. The editorial and design staff at the press distinguished themselves with Volume One, demonstrating their skill, imagination, and de­ votion. The project editors are especially grateful for the priv­ ilege of working with Penny Moudrianakis, Barbara Lamb, Martha  Farlow, Jim Johnston, Robert  Brugger,  and  Henry Y. K. Tom.</p>
