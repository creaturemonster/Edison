<p>The progress of the Thomas A. Edison Papers depends on the support of many individuals and organizations, including the Sponsors, other financial contributors, academic scholars, Edison specialists, librarians, archivists, curators, and students.All of the represen tatives of the four Sponsors have assisted the project with this volume and the editors thank them for their loyal concern and attention. The strong support of public and private foundations and of their program officers has sustained the project and helped it maintain editorial productivity.</p>
<p>The preparation of this volume was made possible in part by grants from the Division of Research Programs (Scholarly Publications) of the National Endowment for the Humanities, an independent federal agency; by grants from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, the Charles Edison Fund, and Dave and Nina Heitz; and through the support of Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, the National Park Service (Edison National Historic Site), and the National Historical Publica­ tions and Records Commission. The editors appreciate the interest and support of many program officers and trustees,
especially Douglas 11. Arnold, Daniel Jones, Timothy Connolly, Michael Meier, Nancy Sahli, Richard N. Sheldon, Raphael Kasper, Doron Weber, Ralph E. Gomory, Paul Chris­ tiansen, David Shantz, John P. Keegan, and Thomas L. Mor­ rissey. Any opinions, findings, conclusions or recommenda­ tions expressed in this publication are solely those of the editors and do not necessarily reflect the views of any of the above federal foundations or agencies, the United States Gov­ ernment, or.any other financial cotributor.</p>
<p>The Edison Papers project is indebted to the National Park Service for its multifaceted support. The editors express par­ ticular  thanks  to Marie Rust, John Maounis, Robert Meintosh, Nancy Waters, Michael Adlerstein, and Tom Dyer of the Northeast Region and Maryanne Gerbauckas, Linda Deveau, Kenneth Chandler, George Tselos, Douglas Tarr, and Edward Wirth of the Edison National Historic Site in West Orange, New Jersey.</p>
<p>Many associates at Rutgers University have contributed significantly to the Edison Papers. Joseph A. Potenza, as Pro­ vost at Rutgers in New Brunswick, made the project a genuine priority, as has Richard F. Foley, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, and his dedicated staff. The same is true of Bruce Newman, Robert Skinner, Mimi Herington, and Sher­ eitte Stokes III of the Rutgers University Foundation . The editors value the support of colleagues and staff in the His­ tory Department, especially Ziva Galili,John Chambers, Ann Gordon, James W. Reed, Rudy Bell, Susan Schrepfer, Philip
]. Pauly, and Michael Adas; William Aspray, Michael Gese­ lowitz, and their staffs at the IEEE History Center and mem­ bers of the Rutgers University Libraries, notably Marianne Gaunt, Ruth Simmons, Peter Graham, Lynn Mullins, and Dan Morgenstern. The support of the Rutgers University ad­ ministration has encouraged the editors and facilitated their work. The staff of the project thank Joseph ]. Seneca, Richard M. Norman, Nancy Winterbauer, Karen Stubaus,John S. Salapatas, Dorothea B. Hoekzema, Andrew B. Rudczynski, David A. Rumbo, Ronald Thompson, Jennifer Roncagliolo, Jac­ quelyn Halvsa, Cynthia Robbins,  Robert Thieme, Cynthia Lydia Jucks, Joseph M. Harrigan, Constance J. Bornheimer,
Judith A. Garelick, Irma Lucy Cardinale, and Sameerah Diaab Allen. Vincent Sgro, Michael Dobe, John Abella, Richard Boniface, and Thomas Vosseler have offered their invalu­ able computer expertise. We have also called on the staff of the Center for Electronic Texts in the Humanities, including Susan Hockey, Larry Scanlon, Gregory Murphy, Wendell Piez, and Christopher Fox.</p>

For this volume, notable help came from Brian Bowers, Raymond Wile, Charles Hummel, Allen Koenigsberg, Bernard S. Finn, Robert Friedel, Edward  Per­ shey, Bernard S. Carlson, Peter Robinson, and Frank Colson. Institutions and their staffs have provided documents, pho­ tographs, photocopies, and research assistance. The staff of the  Henry  Ford  Museum  & Greenfield  Village-especially William  S. Pretzer, John  Bowditch,  Charles Hanson, Judy Endelman,  Linda  Skolarus,   and Jeanine  Head-have  provided many invaluable services. The City of Ft. Myers, Flor­ ida, and the trustees and staff of its Edison-Ford Winter Homes-notably Michele Wehrwein Albion, Judy  Suprise, Jim Newton, and Les Marietta-have assisted the Edison Papers. Likewise, Sheldon Hochheiser of the Corporate Re­ search Archives at AT&T has advised and assisted the project.
