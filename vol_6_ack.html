<p>The progress of the Thomas A. Edison Papers depends on the support of many individuals and organizations, including the Sponsors, other ﬁnancial contributors, academic scholars, Edison specialists, librarians, archivists, curators, and stu- dents. Representatives of the four Sponsors have assisted with this volume and the editors thank them for their continuing concern and attention. The strong support of public and private foundations and of their program ofﬁcers has sustained the project and helped it remain editorially productive.</p>

<p>Preparation of this volume was made possible in part by grants from the Division of Research Programs (Scholarly Editions) of the National Endowment for the Humanities, an independent federal agency; the National Historical Publica- tions and Records Commission; the New Jersey Historical Commission; the Charles Edison Fund; the National Trust for the Humanities; as well as through the support of Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, and the National Park Service (Edison National Historic Site). The editors appreci- ate the interest and support of the many program ofﬁcers and trustees, especially Elizabeth Arndt, Michael Hall, Timothy Connolly, Marc Mappen, Mary Murrin, Howard Green, John P. Keegan, Malcolm Richardson, Ann Orr, and Francis X. O’Brien. Any opinions, ﬁndings, conclusions, or recommen- dations expressed in this publication are solely those of the ed- itors and do not necessarily reﬂect the views of any of the above federal foundations or agencies, the United States Govern- ment, or any other ﬁnancial contributor.</p>

<p>The Edison Papers project is indebted to the National Park Service for its multifaceted support. The editors express particular thanks to Marie Rust, John Maounis, and Nancy Waters of the Northeast Region, and to Maryanne Gerbauckas, Theresa Jung, Roger Durham, Leonard DeGraaf, Douglas Tarr, Edward Wirth, Karen Sloat-Olsen, Linda Deveau, Ger- ald Fabris, Joseph De Monte, Charles Magale, Marilyn Kyles, and Clarence Askew of the Edison National Historic Site in West Orange, New Jersey.
Many associates at Rutgers University have contributed signiﬁcantly to the Edison Papers. The editors are grateful to President Richard L. McCormick; Philip Furmanski, Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs; and Holly M. Smith, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, along with her ded- icated staff, especially Barry V. Qualls, Dean for Humanities; Robert Wilson, Executive Vice Dean; and Barbara Lemanski, Associate Dean for Policy and Personnel. We would especially like to thank Paul Kuznekoff, Director of Development for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. In addition we appreciate the efforts of business manager Rebecca Steika and the support provided by John Amodeo, Thomas Vosseler, and the staff of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Computer & Network Operations Group, especially unit computing manager David Motovidlak. The editors value the support of colleagues and staff in the History Department, especially Michael Adas, Rudy Bell, Alastair Bellany, Luigi Andrea Berto, John Cham- bers, Paul Clemens, Ziva Galili, Ann Gordon, Reese V. Jenk- ins, Matt Matsuda, Philip J. Pauly, James W. Reed, Susan Schrepfer, Virginia Yans, Dawn Ruskai, Candace Walcott- Shepherd, and Mary DeMeo. We also want to thank Michael Geselowitz and his staff at the IEEE History Center as well as members of the Rutgers University Libraries, notably Marianne Gaunt, Thomas Frusciano, Ron Becker, Tom Glynn, Jim Niessen, Rhonda Marker, and the Interlibrary Loan Ofﬁce. A special thanks is due Michael Siegel, staff cartographer in the Department of Geography, who prepared the maps in this vol- ume. At the Rutgers University Foundation we have had the assistance of Carol P. Herring, Linda Corcoran, John Pearson, and Jacqueline Perkel-Joseph. We also want to thank Ronald Thompson and Steve Miller of the Division of Grant and Contract Accounting, Donna Foster of the Ofﬁce of Research and Sponsored Programs, Stephen J. DiPaolo and Joseph M. Harrigan of the Controller’s Ofﬁce, and Allison Thomas of University Relations.</p>

<p>Many scholars have shared their insights and assisted the editors in a variety of ways. For this volume, notable help came from Brian Bowers (who provided the list of Edison’s British patents in Appendix 5), Andrew Butrica, Jane Mork Gibson, James H. Graebner, Cathy Moran Hajo, Gregory Jankunis, Esther Katz, Claudio Pavese, Alvin J. Salkind, Hal Wallace, and Mira Wilkins.
Institutions and their staff have provided documents, pho- tographs, photocopies, and research assistance. The staff of the Henry Ford Museum & Greenﬁeld Village has supplied many valuable services; Marc Greuther, in particular, ﬁelded innumerable questions and brought to the editors’ attention important documentation about Edison dynamos. The editors also gratefully acknowledge Christopher Baer at the Hagley Museum and Library; Ronald Brashear at the Smithsonian Institution’s Dibner Library of the History of Science and Technology; Charles Greifenstein and Valerie-Anne Lutz, both of the American Philosophical Society; Janet Linde, archivist for the New York Stock Exchange; and the reference staff of the New York Public Library’s Science Industry and Business Library.</p>

<p>Staff members, interns, students, and visiting editors not mentioned on the title page but who have contributed to this volume include Thomas E. Jeffrey, Grace Kurkowski, Helen Endick, David Ranzan, Margaret O’Connell, Blaine Mc- Cormick, Rick Mizelle, and the late Tony Cautillo, who is missed.</p>

<p>As always, the project has had the beneﬁt of the superb staff of the Johns Hopkins University Press. For this volume, the editors are indebted to Robert J. Brugger, Julie McCarthy, and Ken Sabol.</p>
