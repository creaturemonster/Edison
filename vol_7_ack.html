<p>The progress of the Thomas A. Edison Papers depends on the support of many individuals and organizations, including the Sponsors, other ﬁnancial contributors, academic scholars, Edison specialists, librarians, archivists, curators, and stu- dents. Representatives of the four Sponsors have assisted with this volume and the editors thank them for their continuing concern and attention. The strong support of public and private foundations and of their program ofﬁcers has sustained the project and helped it remain editorially productive.</p>

<p>Preparation of this volume was made possible in part by grants from the Division of Research Programs (Scholarly Editions) of the National Endowment for the Humanities, an independent federal agency; the National Historical Publications and Records Commission; the New Jersey Historical Commission; the Charles Edison Fund; the National Trust  for the Humanities; as well as through the support of Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, and the National Park Service (Thomas Edison National Historical Park). The edi- tors appreciate the interest and support of the many program ofﬁcers and trustees, especially Elizabeth Arndt, Timothy Connolly, Sara Cureton, John P. Keegan, Marc Mappen, Peter Mickulas, and Malcolm Richardson. Any opinions, ﬁndings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in this publication are solely those of the editors and do not necessarily reﬂect the views of any of the above federal foundations or agencies, the United States Government, or any other ﬁnancial contributor.</p>
