<p>The progress of the Thomas A. Edison Papers depends on the support of many individuals and organizations, ﬁnancial contributors, academic scholars, Edison specialists, librarians, archivists, curators, and students. Representatives of the  four Overseeing Institutions (Rutgers, the National Park Service, the New Jersey Historical Commission, and the Smithson-  ian Institution) have assisted with this volume and the editors thank them for their continuing concern and attention. The strong support of public and private foundations and of their program ofﬁcers has sustained the project and helped it re- main editorially productive.</p>
<p>Preparation of this volume was made possible in part by grants from the Division of Research Programs (Scholarly Editions) of the National Endowment for the Humanities, an independent federal agency; the National Historical Publi- cations and Records Commission; the New Jersey Historical Commission; the Charles Edison Fund; the Cinco Hermanos Fund; as well as through the support of Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, and the National Park Service (Thomas Edison National Historical Park). The editors ap- preciate the interest and support of the many program ofﬁcers and trustees, especially Elizabeth Arndt, Jason Boffetti, Lucy Barber, Timothy Connolly, Sara  Cureton,  Niquole  Primi-  ani, and Skylar Harris.
