<p>The Thomas A. Edison Papers project has benefited from substantial assistance, ranging from the sponsorship and financial support of major institutions to research assistance and documentary information from scholars, archivists, collectors, administrators, and students. From its inception in the mid-1970s, the project has been a team effort. Leaders from the New Jersey Historical Commission, including John T. Cunningham, Bernard Bush, Paul A. Stellhorn, Richard Waldron, and Ronald Grele, initiated discussions with Arthur Reed Abel, William Binnewies, Lynn Wightman, and Eliza­ beth Albro of the National Park Service's Edison National Historic Site. The two groups soon attracted the participation of Brooke Hindle and Bernard Finn of the Smithsonian In­ stitution. With financial aid from the Edison Electric Insti­ tute, they then engaged James Brittain, a distinguished his­ torian of technology at the Georgia Institute of Technology, to prepare a feasibility study. After considering Brittain's rec­ ommendations, the representatives of the National Park Ser­ vice, the New Jersey Historical Commission, and the Smith­ sonian Institution invited Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey to join in cosponsoring the Thomas A. Edison Papers project. President Edward Blaustein, Paul Pearson, Richard· P. McCormick, James Kirby Martin, and Tilden Edelstein of Rutgers responded with enthusiasm, and in 1978 the project began its work with headquarters at Rutgers Uni­ versity in New Brunswick and a second office at the Edison National Historic Site in West Orange.</p>

<p>Since the early days of the project, a number of people and organizations have assisted with obtaining financial support. In the private sector, William C. Hittinger of RCA Corpora­ tion chaired the Edison Corporate Associates and recruited distinguished executives as members of this fund-raising group. His outstanding leadership elicited similar efforts from Morris Tanenbaum of AT&T, Arthur M.Bueche and Roland
W. Schmitt of the General Electric Company, Robert I.Smith and Harold  W. Sonn of Public  Service Electric and Gas Company, Paul J. Christiansen of the Charles Edison Fund, Cees Bruynes of North American Philips Corporation, Paul Lego and Philip F. Dietz of Westinghouse Electric Corpora­ tion, and President Bloustein of Rutgers University. John Venable ·of the Charles Edison Fund, Samuel Convissor of RCA Corporatoin, Edmund Tucker of the General Electric Foundation, George Wise of the General Electric Company, and Robert T. Cavanagh of North American Philips Corpo­ ration also devoted special efforts to fund raising. Bruce Newman, Ronald Miller, Denise Lyons, and Robert Lusardi of the Rutgers University Foundation have served as genuine partners in the financial program of the Edison Papers.</p>

<p>Private and public foundations have awarded grants that are vital to the project. Two long-term grants from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and awards from the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation and the Hyde and Watson Foundation are notable. The preparation of this volume was made possible in part by grants from the Program for Editions of the National Endowment for the .Humanities, an independent agency, and by grants from the Program in History and Philosophy of Sci­ ence and the Engineering Division of the National Science Foundation (SES-8109665, SES-8213220, DIR-8521524). Ronald Overmann and Nam Suh of the National Science Foundation, and Katherine Fuller  and George Farr of the National Endowment for the Humanities, have provided val­ uable counsel. Any opinions, findings, conclusions, or rec­ ommendations expressed in this publication, however, are those of the editors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation or any other financial con­ tributor. </p>

<p>The editors of this project have benefited from the advice and assistance of many historical editors. Special appreciation is due Edward C. Carter II and Darwin H. Stapleton of the Papers of Benjamin Henry Latrobe; Nathan Reingold, Ar­ thur P. Molella, Marc Rothenberg, and Kathleen Waldenfels Dorman of the Papers of Joseph Henry; Arthur Link  and David Hirst of the Woodrow Wilson apers; Louis Galambos of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Papers; and Carl Prince of the William Livingston Papers. Frank Burke, Rogers Bruns, Mary Giunta, Richard Sheldon, and George Vogt of the Na­ tional Historical Publications and Records Commission have encouraged and guided the editors since the project's incep­ tion.
Many other scholars have given advice, shared informa­ tion, discussed  issues, or provided special assistance. The editors are especially grateful to Brooke Hindle, Bernard Finn, James Brittain, Thomas P. Hughes, Melvin Kranzberg, Hugh Aitken, Merritt Roe Smith, Alfred D. Chandler, Jr., Robert Schofield, Edwin T. Layton,.Robert Friedel, Michael Mahoney, Brian Bowers, and Kenneth Rowe. </p>

<p>The project is indebted to many institutions and their staffs for the provision of documents, photographs, photocopies, and research assistance. Staff members of Greenfield Village and the Henry Ford Museum have extended themselves, es­ pedally John Bowditch, Tim Binkley, Steven K. Hamp, Jean­ ine Head, Mary Beth Kreiner, Larry McCans, William  S. Pretzer, and Cynthia Read-Miller. Similar help came from Joyce Bedi of the IEEE History Center, Bernard Finn of the Smithsonian Institution, Florence Bartechevski and Robert W. Lovett of the Baker Library at Harvard University, Ken­ neth A. Lohf of the Butler Library at Columbia University, Millie Daghli of the Corporate Research Archives at AT&T, Mrs. E. D. P. Symons of the Institute of Electrical Engineers in London, Margaret Jasko of Western Union Telegraph Company, Charles F. Cummings of the Newark Public Li­ brary, Steven Catlett of the American Philosophical Society, Don C. Skemer of the New Jersey Historical Commission, Deborah S. Gardner of the New York Stock Exchange Ar­ chives, and Mrs. C. I. Constantinides of the Post Office Ar­ chives in London. The project is also indebted to several _per­ sons in the Federal Archives and Record Service: Marjorie Ciarlante and John Butler in Washington,  D.C.; James K. Owens in Waltham, Mass.; and Joel Buchwald and Donna Cabarle in Bayonne, NJ. Others who have provided re­ sources or special assistance include Charles Hummel, Patty Dahm Pascoe, Charles F. Kempf, Dorothy C. Serrell, Frank Andrews, Theodore Edison, and John Edison Sloane. </p>

<p>Many people associated with the National Park Service have contributed significantly to this project. Especially no­ table are Herbert S. Cables, Jr., ad Edward Dallop of the Boston Regional Office and Fahy Whittaker, Mary Bowling, Edward Pershey, Roy W. Weaver, Lynn Wighunan, William Binnewies, Ray Kremer, Arthur Reed Abel, and Elizabeth Albro of the Edison National Historic Site. </p>

<p>The editors are especially appreciative of friends at Rut­ gers University. Encouragement and assistance have come from colleagues in the History Department, especially from Richard P. McCormick, James W. Reed, Susan R. Schrepfer, Philip Pauly,  Gerald N. Grob, Seth  Scheiner, Michael P. Adas, John R. Gillis, and Richard L. McCormick. Notable administrative support has come from Edward Blaustein, T. Alexander Pond, Tilden G. Edelstein, Nathaniel Pallone, Jose Steinboch, David A. Cayer, Kenneth Wheeler, Paul L. Leath, Jean Parrish, Peter D. Klein, John Salapatas, Robert F. Pack, David R. Scott, Andrew B. Rudczynski, Albert Hanna, David A. Rumbo, Donna Estler, Muriel Wilson, Helen Gertler, Joseph Harrigan, and Ruth Scott. Major assistance has come from the staff of the Rutgers University Libraries, especially Ruth Simmons, Francis Johns, Ronald
L. Becker, and Clark L. Beck, Jr. </p>

<p>Several staff members, interns, and students not named on the title page contributed in various ways to this volume. These include Susan Schultz, W. Bernard Carlson, Andre Millard , Mary Ann Hellrigel, Douglas G. Tarr, David W. Hutchings, Ann Nigro, David Fowler, Harry Goldsmith, Jac­ quelyn Miller, Matthew McCright, Dana Norvila, David Rhees, and Alain Canuel. Significant photographic work was done by James Anness, Patricia Matteson, Richard W. Mitch­ ell, Rudy Ruzicska, and William Winter. </p>

<p>Any book owes a debt to the press that publishes it. In the case of the Edison Papers, the complexity of the material magnifies the debt manyfold. The staff of the Johns Hopkins University Press has worked heroically throughout the pro­ duction of this volume, and the editors particularly wish to thank Penny Moudrianakis and Barbara Lamb for their painstaking editorial guidance; Martha Farlow and Jim John­ ston for the design and production of a very difficult volume; Henry Y. K. Tom, George F. Thompson, and Denise Dank­ ert for their counsel; and, finally, Director Jack Goeliner for his unstinting support. </p>

<p>The editors conclude with a tribute to two very special people: our assistant to the director, Helen Endick, and our secretary, Grace Kurkowski . The talent, devotion, and good humor they bring to their administrative, secretarial, and edi­ torial tasks are truly extraordinary and vital to the project. </p>
